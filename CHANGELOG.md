## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.0] - 2026-10-19

First public release.

### Added
- Automatic straightening (±15°), crop, lane detection, ladder identification and band-size labels for DNA agarose gels.
- Editing directly on the figure: lane names (IME-safe), group lines by dragging, `+`/`−` condition rows, target-band arrows with estimated sizes (`≈` when extrapolated or when markers disagree).
- 21 built-in ladders (Thermo GeneRuler, NEB, Takara, TransGen, Tiangen), custom ladders and favourites.
- Several exposures of one gel can be loaded together; the best is chosen and switching keeps annotations.
- Rotation keeps lanes, bands, arrows and the crop box aligned with the gel; reference grid.
- Lane removal with splice gaps or lines (`H` key), empty-lane suggestions, marker-lane confirmation.
- Pre-flight check before export: camera saturation vs. contrast clipping, effective resolution, font size, extrapolated sizes.
- Exports: PNG with resolution, sRGB and embedded processing summary; LZW TIFF; SVG; uncropped image with the same processing; original file with SHA-256; JSON processing log.
- Project files (`.gelfig`), style templates (carrying custom ladders), autosaved drafts, per-section and full resets.
- English and Chinese interface.
- Content Security Policy that blocks all network access.
- Engine and interaction self-tests, run in Chromium, Firefox and WebKit.
